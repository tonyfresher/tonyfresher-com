Hey! I’m Anton Fresher. Generally, you would see me jumping in between design, software engineering, product work, leadership, and writing, still figuring out what to do with all this.

Now I'm building a core platform at <Link href='https://practicum.com' view='filled' color='#ff976b'>Practicum</Link>, a beginner-friendly online coding bootcamp.

Before Practicum, I was a software engineer at <Link href='https://yandex.com' view='filled' color='#fbcb70'>Yandex</Link>. Earlier—got a BSc in math and computer science at the Ural Federal University.
