Hey! I’m Anton ![My photo](/anton-fresher.jpeg)

Generally, you would see me jumping in between design, software engineering, product management, leadership, and writing, still figuring out what to do with all this.

Now I'm building a core learning platform at <Link href='https://tripleten.com' view='filled' color='#ff976b'>TripleTen</Link>, a family of online coding bootcamps.

Before that, I was a product designer at <Link href='https://practicum.yandex.ru' view='filled' color='#d5d6d8'>Yandex Practicum</Link>. Previously, worked as a software engineer at <Link href='https://surveys.yandex.com/' view='filled' color='#b8caf4'>Yandex Surveys</Link>, and earned a BSc in math and computer science.
