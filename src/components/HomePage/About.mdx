Hey! I’m Anton Fresher. Generally, you would see me jumping in between design, software engineering, product work, leadership, and writing, still figuring out what to do with all this.

Now I'm building a core learning platform at <Link href='https://tripleten.com' view='filled' color='#ff976b'>TripleTen</Link>, online part-time coding bootcamps.

Before TripleTen, I was a software engineer at <Link href='https://yandex.com' view='filled' color='#fbcb70'>Yandex</Link> and got a BSc in math and computer science.
