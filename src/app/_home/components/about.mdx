Over the past 8 years in tech, I've learned I fit right in with fast-paced early-stage teams, where adapting to change and navigating uncertainty are part of the adventure.

In lots of parts of my life, I'm a generalist. I love moving across roles and functions to find creative solutions, ship products people love, and—most importantly—have fun along the way.

Beyond writing words and moving pixels, I try to explore the world as much as I can. Discovering amazing places, people, and [cultural gems](https://t.me/+TT5uDGL6_txhZTRi) grounds and inspires me.
