Hey! I'm Anton ![My photo](/me.jpeg)

For the past 8 years, I’ve been working as a product designer and engineer, finding my place in tight-knit early-stage teams where I’m comfortable navigating uncertainty and doing whatever it takes to build a product people want. A generalist at heart, I’m always exploring where my craft should evolve next.

I cut my teeth in consumer mobile and B2B SaaS but later found my true curiosity in education — especially how it can be transformed by AI. With a background in math and computer science, I’m a pretty technical person, yet what drives me most is using tech to make a positive impact on people’s lives.

Now I'm designing a product at <Link href='https://tripleten.com' view='filled' color='#ff976b'>TripleTen</Link>, a family of online tech bootcamps.

Before that: product design at <Link href='https://practicum.yandex.ru' view='filled' color='#d5d6d8'>Yandex Practicum</Link>, software engineering at <Link href='https://surveys.yandex.com/' view='filled' color='#b8caf4'>Yandex Surveys</Link>, and a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science.
