Hey! I'm Anton ![My photo](/me.jpeg) a product designer and engineer.

Over the past 8 years in tech, I’ve learned I’m most useful in fast-paced early-stage teams, helping navigate uncertainty and build products people love.

In many parts of my life, I’m a generalist. I love moving across roles and functions to ship high-quality products, find creative solutions, and—most importantly—have fun along the way.
