Over the past 8 years in tech, I've learned I fit right in with fast-paced early-stage teams, helping navigate uncertainty and build products people love.

In lots of parts of my life, I'm a generalist. I love moving across roles and functions to ship great products, find creative solutions, and—most importantly—have fun along the way.

I'm always up to meet kindred people. To get in touch, drop me a line at hey@tonyfresher.com.
