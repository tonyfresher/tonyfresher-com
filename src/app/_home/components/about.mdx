Hey! I'm Anton ![My photo](/me.jpeg) a product designer and engineer.

Over the past 8 years, I’ve found my place in tight-knit early-stage teams where I’m comfortable navigating uncertainty and doing whatever it takes to build a product people love.

In many parts of my life, I’m a generalist. I love moving across roles and functions to find novel solutions, ship high quality products, and—most importantly—have fun along the way.
