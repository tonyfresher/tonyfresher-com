Hey! I'm Anton ![My photo](/me.jpeg) a product designer and engineer.

For the past 8 years working, I’ve found my place in tight-knit early-stage teams where I’m comfortable navigating uncertainty and doing whatever it takes to build a product people want.

In many parts of my life, I’m a generalist. I love moving across roles and functions to find novel solutions, ship higher quality products, and—most importantly—have fun along the way.
