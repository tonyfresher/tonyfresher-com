[Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) is one of the largest ed-tech products in Russia. It offers a variety of reskilling and upskilling courses for digital professions: from learning a new tool to completely changing your career.

[Headlight](https://practicum.com/) is a beginner-friendly online coding bootcamp that operates in the US and 14 other countries. The product was launched in 2020 by the Practicum team and had entirely separated from the original company in the 2022.

Practicum was the first place I went after switching from engineering to design. I learned a lot while moving between teams and roles—mostly as an individual contributor. It was even more challenging when after a year in Practicum I shifted from a mature product with over 1,200 employees to a much smaller, Series A stage international startup without a clear market fit and stable unit economy.

Building a product design culture and processes from the ground up at the same time as product development never was easy, but always fun. These are the main lessons learned I want to share.

Before coming to Practicum, I had worked as a software engineer and had been around product design for a couple of years. I enjoyed engineering for the opportunity to directly build a product and control all the details of the user experience. By transitioning to product design, I wanted to shift my focus from technical limitations to the product and user experience. I was fascinated by the chance to delve into product design and combine it with polishing the final product with code.

After half a year of searching for the right place, I came to the Practicum team. When I completed a design exercise and heard the words "let's try", I immediately accepted the offer. Creating a product of that size and influence was my dream—Practicum had around 4,000 new students per month at the time. Practicum's challenges and chaotic processes also inspired me. It was the perfect contrast to the settled B2B product atmosphere of my previous job.

My role was a bit tricky from the outset. Half of my time, I had to design and develop interactive math explanations. Practicum offers a family of programs on data science and data analysis, and a good math foundation is needed for these careers. To make these programs more accessible, the Practicum team created an advanced mathematics course. Instead of another boring textbook, they wanted to create an engaging trainer filled with practice, storytelling, and interactive explanations―the latter of which I helped design and develop.

Although making interactive explanations sounded fun, it quickly became a repetitive routine. I worked with an infographic designer and two illustrators. It was clear that the infographic designer in charge of the content, the illustrators were in charge of the visuals, and the only thing I was in charge of was the code. I soon realized that my job became a combination of an interaction designer and junior web developer—each interactive was a simple React app with texts, shapes, and a little bit of Framer Motion magic.

In parallel, I spent the other half of my time as a junior product designer. I assisted two other designers with the main platform design. Looking back on those days, I can see how simple my first contributions were: designing a receipt, adding buttons, and thinking of an admin interface for a new quiz type. And yet, I realized that this work was much closer to what I wanted to do in the future.

Soon, I understood that I couldn't either create quick production of math explanations, or take on ambitious product design tasks: I failed my first big task of redesigning the payment methods block for the growth team. It was clear that the "sitting on two chairs" situation wasn't working.

As I reflected, this situation was caused by different expectations from the beginning. I wanted to do product design and take responsibility, the infographic designer wanted me to make her explanations come alive, the platform product designers wanted me to help with small tasks, and the hiring design manager wanted me to cover two team needs at once.

Two months after the start, I had made a handful of difficult conversations, helped the team hire and onboard two part-time React developers, and become a full-fledged product designer.
