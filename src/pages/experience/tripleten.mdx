[TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/) helps people with diverse backgrounds learn a new profession and build a sustainable career in tech. It was launched in 2020 by employees of Yandex Practicum—the largest Russian online learning platform—and shortly after became an independent startup operating in the US, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.

I joined TripleTen as one of the first designers when it had just started building its full-fledged product team. Over the three years, I worked on the core study platform, maintained the design system, and crafted the overall design process within the company. Here are a few examples of my work.

# TripleTen’s new homepage

TripleTen's homepage plays a major role in the student experience. It's where they start their learning, track their progress, revisit past material, check payment status, and more. In fact, 30% of all user sessions include the homepage.

That's why TripleTen's homepage has become a place for regular experiments, new feature updates, and other types of changes that require a scalable design. When I joined the company, our homepage was neither user-friendly nor flexible. Throughout my time at Yandex Practicum and TripleTen, I tried to change this. It took almost two years and led to the complete rebuilding of the homepage. So, this is a story of how we reboot our homepage.

## How it started

TripleTen inherited its homepage from Yandex Practicum, along with the rest of the platform. Initially, the homepage was dead simple: a large card displaying the current lesson, and a few more blocks to monitor overall progress and navigate between the program's modules.

There were many issues with this page. For example, a quarter of the space was occupied by a black column listing enrolled programs. This was completely unnecessary, as most of our students only enroll in one program at a time, so switching between them is rarely required.

## Spin-off: The Homepage 2.0 project

At Yandex Practicum, we have always wanted to build advanced learning productivity tools, such as a study calendar, planner, streaks, favorites, etc. However, implementing these features was challenging due to a high amount of technical and design debt. In addition, our focus on growth at that time meant that these features were always deprioritized.

In response to this, the Homepage 2.0 project was born. This was a radical re-imagining of the entire homepage, which mostly came from one designer's mind. It was quite conceptual and included many features that didn't exist at the time. Some of these mechanics were eventually implemented a long time after, while others remain concepts to this day.

You can already guess that this project never made it to the production stage. It crashed into the asphalt of real life, as we used to say back then—as well as countless hours of work from the designers who contributed to this project. I personally designed a calendar widget, new content navigation, progress widget, and program showcase page.

Despite this, I never regretted the amount of work I put in, as it taught me two invaluable lessons. Firstly, it's usually best to introduce big changes to a product incrementally. This makes it easier for users to adapt and simpler for developers to implement. Secondly, it highlighted the value of a deep understanding of the product needed to make disruptive changes. If I were to look at this project now, I'd quickly realize that many of the designed features can't be implemented without investing a lot of time to eliminate legacy from the information architecture and unify the study process across different programs. We eventually began doing this a year later.

More than that, for me, as a newbie, redesigning a large part of the product was the perfect chance to learn about the product, its information architecture, and its limitations.
