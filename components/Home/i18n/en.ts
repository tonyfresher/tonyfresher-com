    about: `
Hey! I’m Anton. Generally, you would see me jumping in between design, software engineering, product management, leadership, and writing, still figuring out what to do with all this.

Now I'm building a core platform at [Practicum](https://practicum.com), a beginner-friendly online coding bootcamp.

Before Practicum, I was a software engineer at [Yandex](https://yandex.com). Earlier—got a BSc in math and computer science at the Ural Federal University.
