    about: `
Hey, I'm Anton. I'm a product designer and developer. I'm currently building a core learning platform at [Practicum](https://practicum.com), a family of digital re-skilling products to help people build sustainable careers in IT.

Before Practicum, I was a web developer at [Yandex Surveys](https://surveys.yandex.com), a tool for researchers where you can simply create a survey and find a suitable audience for it. Earlier—[Yandex Weather iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-weather-online-forecast/id1041008044), Math+CS at UrFU.

I also irregularly write and play on my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+TT5uDGL6_txhZTRi) (ru).
